# Politics & War Scripts

A Python API wrapper for Politics & War. A few example scripts are provided at the content root:

* `global_stats.py` - provides an overview of all nations in the game
* `megatron.py` - an IRC bot
* `nation.py` - fetches and calculates information on a specific nation

This is a mostly feature-complete release, though it is lacking in documentation and some niceties.
